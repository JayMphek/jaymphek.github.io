                <h2>Research Overview</h2>
                <p>This Honours research project addresses the critical need for early breast cancer detection in
                    South Africa, where healthcare resources are often limited and access to specialized
                    radiologists is constrained. By leveraging artificial intelligence, this system aims to assist
                    healthcare professionals in making more accurate and timely diagnoses.</p>

                    <p>Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths among women globally, and
                        early detection significantly improves treatment outcomes and survival rates. This research
                        focuses on developing an AI-powered system that can autonomously detect and classify breast
                        cancer abnormalities in mammography images, providing crucial support to healthcare
                        professionals in resource-constrained environments.</p>
