                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>PeriodPledge is a mobile application that integrates menstrual cycle tracking with period poverty
                    awareness and support initiatives. The app bridges the gap between menstrual health tracking and
                    period poverty advocacy, providing a comprehensive platform for education, community support, and
                    resource access.</p>

                <div class="problem-statement">
                    <h3>The Challenge of Period Poverty</h3>
                    <p>Period poverty refers to the lack of access to menstrual products, hygiene facilities, education,
                        and healthcare due to financial constraints or societal stigma. This issue disproportionately
                        affects low-income individuals, students, and people in marginalized communities, leading to
                        severe consequences such as poor menstrual hygiene, missed school or workdays, and long-term
                        health risks.</p>
                    <p>In South Africa, research has shown that many schoolgirls miss up to a week of school per month
                        due to lack of menstrual supplies, which contributes to gender inequality in education and
                        career opportunities.</p>
